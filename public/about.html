<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is Megan Johnston. I was born on the 13th of October and finished my Matric in 2023. (I really like that funny number, 13/2023)</p>

<p>I took all the base subjects, as well as CAT(Computer Applications Technology), Visual Arts and EGD(Engineering Graphics and Design). 
   I learned to code in my CAT class and with considering my future, I decided that I really wanted to continue my journey in life with coding.
   With my final project for the class, we had to design a website from scratch using Notebook++, containing info on the subject we had to research.
   I vividly remember my struggles, but also the feeling of satisfaction when I figured something
   out that had been bugging me for a while.
</p>

<p>I really enjoy sitting down with a website and struggling with it, because at the end of the day
   you can't learn anything without struggling and feeling like you want to rip every single hair
   out of your head.

<p>♦As just a little side note, I am working through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy's Web Bootcamp, taught by Dr. Angela Yu</a>
   and so far I am really enjoying it. It covers basic HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps.♦
